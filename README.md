# Portfolio

Hi, I'm Shanique!

I have a strong analytical background in Biochemistry and recently completed a Data Science, AI, and Machine Learning bootcamp. My passion for uncovering meaningful insights through data drives my excitement to step into the field of data science as an entry-level Data Specialist.

Through my training, I've developed a sharp ability to analyze complex datasets and identify patterns and trends. My experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis has strengthened my problem-solving skills and ability to generate actionable insights.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, always looking to expand my knowledge and improve my skills. Whether working independently or as part of a team, Iâ€™m motivated by the thrill of discovering insights and using data to solve complex problems.

### Healthcare Data Integration Pipeline  

**Code:** [Healthcare Data Integration Pipeline](https://github.com/SHANIQUETS/Healthcare-Integration-Pipeline/blob/main/integrated_data_pipeline.ipynb)  

## Goal  
To integrate and manage healthcare datasets to improve data accessibility and operational efficiency.  

## Description  
This project focused on building a pipeline to integrate and process healthcare data from multiple sources. The pipeline handled data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) to create a unified and structured dataset. The project involved data cleaning and preprocessing, handling missing values, and automating the data integration process to ensure accuracy and consistency. Statistical analysis and data visualization were used to uncover insights and improve healthcare service delivery.  

## Skills  
Data integration, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), data cleaning, statistical analysis, automation, data visualization.  

## Technology  
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SQL.  

## Results  
The pipeline successfully integrated multiple datasets, improving data accuracy and consistency. The automated process reduced manual errors and streamlined data accessibility for healthcare professionals, enhancing decision-making and operational efficiency.  

### Mobile Phone Price Prediction  

**Code:** [Mobile Phone Price Predictor](https://github.com/SHANIQUETS/Portfolio/blob/main/Mobile_Phone_Price_Predictor.ipynb)


## Goal  
To develop a machine learning model to predict the price category of mobile phones based on their features.  

## Description  
This project involved building a machine learning model to predict mobile phone price categories using a dataset containing various phone specifications such as battery power, RAM, screen size, and processor speed. The project included data cleaning and preprocessing, feature selection, model training and evaluation, and performance tuning. Various classification models were tested to identify the most accurate and efficient approach.  

## Skills  
Data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, classification, performance evaluation, data visualization.  

## Technology

## Results  
The final model achieved high accuracy in predicting mobile phone price categories. The analysis highlighted that features such as RAM and battery power have the strongest influence on price prediction.  


### Netflix Content Trends Analysis  

**Code:** [Analyzing Netflix Content Trends](https://github.com/SHANIQUETS/Portfolio/blob/main/Analysing_Netflix_Content_Trends_checkpoint.ipynb)

## Goal  
To analyze trends in Netflix content to identify patterns in genres, release dates, and content ratings.  

## Description  
This project involved analyzing a Netflix dataset to uncover trends and insights in the platform's content. The dataset included information on movie and TV show titles, genres, release years, content ratings, and duration. The analysis covered data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), identifying the most popular genres and content types over time, and analyzing content ratings and their distribution across genres and release years.  

## Skills  
Data cleaning, data analysis, pattern recognition, data visualization.  

## Technology  
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.  

## Results  
The analysis revealed that certain genres and content types have increased in popularity over the years, with a notable shift in content rating distribution. The project provided actionable insights into Netflix's content strategy and viewer preferences.
